# My AI-Generated Learning Path!

Hi there! This repository is a collection of projects and coding assignments generated by AI to help me learn, improve and practice my programming skills.

## How it works:
1. I ask the AI to provide a project requirement or a coding task from scratch.
2. I write the code entirely by myself without any AI assistance during the process. I only use the AI's initial promt, which defines how the code should function, the required features and necessary parameters.
3. I often go beyong the initial requirements by adding custom features, extra validation checks and further optimizations.


## The goal is to reinforce my logic and problem-solving abilities through pure practice.
